Its code and weights are freely licensed for commercial and personal use, including training new models. In tests, it outperformed o1 on 5 of 11 benchmarks.","A new open model rivals OpenAI’s o1, and it’s free to use or modify.

What’s new: DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that executes long lines of reasoning before producing output. The code and weights are licensed freely for commercial and personal use, including training new models on R1 outputs. The paper provides an up-close look at the training of a high-performance model that implements a chain of thought without explicit prompting. (DeepSeek-R1-lite-preview came out in November with fewer parameters and a different base model.)

Mixture of experts (MoE) basics: The MoE architecture uses different subsets of its parameters to process different inputs. Each MoE layer contains a group of neural networks, or experts, preceded by a gating module that learns to choose which one(s) to use based on the input. In this way, different experts learn to specialize in different types of examples. Because not all parameters are used to produce any given output, the network uses less energy and runs faster than models of similar size that use all parameters to process every input.

How it works: DeepSeek-R1 is a version of DeepSeek-V3-Base that was fine-tuned over four stages to enhance its ability to process a chain of thought (CoT). It’s a mixture-of-experts transformer with 671 billion total parameters, 37 billion of which are active at any given time, and it processes 128,000 tokens of input context. Access to the model via DeepSeek’s API costs $0.55 per million input tokens ($0.14 for cached inputs) and $2.19 per million output tokens. (In comparison, o1 costs $15 per million input tokens, $7.50 for cached inputs, and $60 per million output tokens.)

The team members fine-tuned DeepSeek-V3-Base on a synthetic dataset of thousands of long-form CoT examples that were generated using multiple techniques. For instance, they prompted DeepSeek-V3-Base few-shot style with long CoTs as examples, prompted that model to generate detailed answers while evaluating and double-checking its own CoT steps,  and hired human annotators to refine and process the results.
They used group relative policy optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to improve the model’s ability to solve challenging problems. For example, for math problems, they created rule-based systems that rewarded the model for returning the final answer in a particular format (an accuracy reward) and for showing its internal CoT steps within <think> tags (a format reward).
For further fine-tuning, they used the in-progress versions of R1 to generate around 600,000 responses to reasoning prompts, retaining only correct responses. They mixed in another 200,000 non-reasoning examples (such as language translation pairs) either generated by DeepSeek-V3-base or from its training dataset.
They fine-tuned the model using a final round of reinforcement learning. This step encouraged the model to further boost its accuracy on reasoning problems while generally improving its helpfulness and harmlessness.
Other models: DeepSeek researchers also released seven related models.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero is similar to DeepSeek-R1, but fine-tuned entirely using reinforcement learning. The researchers note that DeepSeek-R1-Zero was able to develop problem-solving strategies simply by being given incentives to do so. However, it was more likely to mix languages and produce unreadable outputs.
DeepSeek also released six dense models (with parameter counts of 1.5 billion, 7 billion, 8 billion, 14 billion, 32 billion, and 70 billion), four of them based on versions of Qwen, and two based on versions of Llama.
Results: In DeepSeek’s tests, DeepSeek-R1 went toe-to-toe with o1, outperforming that model on 5 of 11 of the benchmarks tested. Some of the other new models showed competitive performance, too.

DeepSeek-R1 topped o1 on AIME 2024, MATH-500, and SWE-Bench Verified, while turning in competitive performance on Codeforces, GPQA Diamond, and MMLU. For instance, on LiveCodeBench, which includes coding problems that are frequently updated, it solved 65.9 percent of problems correctly, while o1 solved 63.4 percent correctly.
It also outperformed two top models that don’t implement chains of thought without explicit prompting. It bested Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 19 of 21 benchmarks and OpenAI GPT-4o on 20 of 21 benchmarks.
In DeepSeek’s tests, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across all benchmarks tested including AIME 2024 and GPQA Diamond, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B beats o1-mini on all benchmarks tested except Codeforces.
Why it matters: Late last year, OpenAI’s o1 kicked off a trend toward so-called reasoning models that implement a CoT without explicit prompting. But o1 and o3, its not-yet-widely-available successor, hide their reasoning steps. In contrast, DeepSeek-R1 bares all, allowing users to see the steps the model took to arrive at a particular answer. DeepSeek’s own experiments with distillation show how powerful such models can be as teachers to train smaller student models. Moreover, they appear to pass along some of the benefits of their reasoning skills, making their students more accurate.

We’re thinking: DeepSeek is rapidly emerging as a strong builder of open models. Not only are these models great performers, but their license permits use of their outputs for distillation, potentially pushing forward the state of the art for language models (and multimodal models) of all sizes.

Is Sony Music Group  allowing to use their work for AI?,"Sony Music Group is forbidding the use of its music or other media such as lyrics, music videos, and album art for training, developing, or commercializing any AI systems. However, they reserve the right to grant specific developers permission to use its material as training data.",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/sony-music-accuses-ai-developers-of-copyright-violations/,"Sony Music Group has prohibited the use of its music, lyrics, music videos, and album art for the training, development, or commercialization of any AI systems.","
The world’s second-largest music publisher accused AI developers of potential copyright violations.

What’s new: Sony Music Group declared that AI developers had trained models on Sony’s intellectual property without permission and that any method of collecting media or other data owned by the company violated its copyrights. Whether AI developers actually have violated copyrights has not been established.

How it works: In a statement posted on the company’s website and letters to developers, Sony forbade the use of its music or other media such as lyrics, music videos, album art for “training, developing, or commercializing any AI systems.”

Sony Music Group sent letters to more than 700 AI developers and streaming services. Letters to AI developers demanded that they reveal which works they had used for training by the following week. Recipients included Google, Microsoft, and text-to-music startups Suno and Udio. Letters sent to streaming services, including Apple and Spotify, asked them to modify their terms of service to prohibit anyone from using streaming services to collect data owned by Sony, among other measures.
It reserved the right to grant specific developers permission to use its material as training data, asking interested parties to contact Sony by email if they wanted to make a deal.
Behind the news: In April, more than 200 music artists called for streaming services and AI developers to stop using their work for training and stop generating music in the styles of specific musicians without compensation. Universal Music Group (UMG), which is Sony Music’s top competitor, has also opposed unrestricted AI-generated music.

Last year, UMG ordered Apple Music and Spotify to block AI developers from downloading its recordings and issued takedown notices to YouTube and Spotify uploaders who generated music that sounds like artists who are under contract to Universal. 

Why it matters: Sony Music Group’s warning comes as generated audio is approaching a level of quality that might attract a mainstream audience, and it could chill further progress. Although it is not yet clear whether training AI systems on music recordings without permission violates copyrights, Sony Music Group has demonstrated its willingness to pursue both individuals and companies for alleged copyright violations. The company accounted for 22 percent of the global music market in 2023. (UMG accounted for 32 percent.) Its catalog includes many of the world’s most popular artists including AC/DC, Adele, Celine Dion, and Harry Styles. 

We’re thinking: We believe that AI developers should be allowed to let their software learn from data that’s freely available on the internet, but uncertainty over the limits of copyright protection isn’t good for anyone. It’s high time to update to intellectual property laws for the era of generative AI."
Which AI companies are working with U.S. government on military and intelligence applications?,"Meta and Anthropic are working with the U.S. government on military and intelligence applications. Meta made its Llama family of large language models available to the U.S. government for national security purposes. ""Meta's partners in the defense and intelligence markets include Accenture, Amazon, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, and Snowflake.",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/meta-and-anthropic-open-doors-for-ai-in-u-s-defense-and-national-security/,Meta and Anthropic ,"Two top AI companies changed their stances on military and intelligence applications.

What’s new: Meta made its Llama family of large language models available to the U.S. government for national security purposes — a major change in its policy on military applications. Similarly, Anthropic will offer its Claude models to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies.

How it works: Meta and Anthropic are relying on partnerships with government contractors to navigate the security and procurement requirements for military and intelligence work.

Meta’s partners in the defense and intelligence markets include Accenture, Amazon, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, and Snowflake. These companies will integrate Llama models into U.S. government applications in areas like logistics, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and tracking terrorists’ financial activities.
Some Meta partners have built specialized versions of Llama. For example, Scale AI fine-tuned Llama 3 for national security applications. Called Defense Llama, the fine-tuned model can assist with tasks such as planning military operations and analyzing an adversary’s vulnerabilities.
Anthropic will make its Claude 3 and 3.5 model families available to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies via a platform built by Palantir, which provides big-data analytics to governments, and hosted by Amazon Web Services. The government will use Claude to review documents, find patterns in large amounts of data, and help officials make decisions.
Behind the news: In 2018, Google faced backlash when it won a contract with the U.S. government to build Project Maven, an AI-assisted intelligence platform. Employees protested, resigned, and called on the company to eschew military AI work. Google withdrew from the project and Palantir took it over. Subsequently, many AI developers, including Meta and Anthropic, have forbidden use of their models for military applications. Llama’s new availability to U.S. military and intelligence agencies is a notable exception. In July, Anthropic, too, began to accommodate use of its models for intelligence work. Anthropic still prohibits using Claude to develop weapons or mount cyberattacks.

Why it matters: The shift in Meta’s and Anthropic’s policies toward military uses of AI is momentous. Lately AI has become a battlefield staple in the form of weaponized drones, and AI companies must take care that their new policies are consistent with upholding human rights. Military uses for AI include not only weapons development and targeting but also potentially life-saving search and rescue, logistics, intelligence, and communications. Moreover, defense contracts represent major opportunities for AI companies that can fund widely beneficial research and applications.

We’re thinking: Peace-loving nations face difficult security challenges, and AI can be  helpful in meeting them. At the same time, the militarization of AI brings challenges to maintaining peace and stability, upholding human rights, and retaining human control over autonomous systems. We call on developers of military AI to observe the guidelines, proposed by Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military, which are endorsed by more than 60 countries and call for robust governance, oversight, accountability, and respect for human rights."
what are the models used in biochemistry?,"AlphaFold 3 is a model that predicts the structures of all biologically active molecules, including proteins, along with their interactions.",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/deepminds-alphafold-3-enhances-3d-biomolecular-modeling/,AlphaFold 3,"The latest update of DeepMind’s AlphaFold model is designed to find the structures of not just proteins but all biologically active molecules as well as interactions between them.

What’s new: Google announced AlphaFold 3, which models the 3D shapes of biomolecules including proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands (molecules that bind to proteins or DNA, which includes antibodies and many drugs) in any combination. AlphaFold Server provides access for noncommercial uses (with some limitations). Unlike earlier versions, AlphaFold 3 is not open source.

Key insight: Given a sequence of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), the previous version of AlphaFold drew on an existing knowledge of amino acid structures, computed their locations and angles, and assembled them like Lego blocks. To adapt the system for molecules that aren’t made of amino acids, AlphaFold 3 represents them as collections of individual atoms and uses a generative model to find their positions in space.

How it works: Given a list of molecules, AlphaFold 3 generates their joint 3D structure, revealing how they fit together. Several transformers hone embeddings of proteins and amino acids, while a diffusion model (also a transformer) processes embeddings of atoms. The team trained the system on five datasets including ground truth protein, DNA, and RNA structures interactions in the Protein Data Bank. They also trained it on protein shapes computed by AlphaFold 2; that model’s explicit knowledge of amino acid structures helped overcome AlphaFold 3’s tendency to hallucinate in some instances. Among the key processes:

Given a protein’s amino acid sequence, a molecule’s set of atoms, or any combination thereof, AlphaFold 3 first represents each common amino acid, nucleotide, and individual atom (that isn’t a part of a common amino acid or nucleotide) with a single token. 
For each token, the system draws on existing databases to compute a variety of features, which fall into five categories: (i) per-token features like position, (ii) features of proteins in the Protein Data Bank, (iii) features of a given molecule, (iv) features derived from a genetic search (for example, whether two amino acid sequences appear to be related evolutionarily) and (v) features that describe chemical bonds between two tokens. 
Given these features, a transformer produces a single embedding that represents all tokens and pairwise embeddings that represent relationships between each pair of tokens. A second transformer refines the pairwise embeddings based on known molecules that share subsequences of amino acids or nucleotides with the input. A third transformer further refines the embeddings.
Given the features, embeddings, and a noisy point cloud of atoms, the diffusion model removes the noise. (That is, it learned to modify the atoms’ positions to match those in their dataset.)
AlphaFold 3 learned to optimize seven additional loss terms, including one that minimized the difference between the predicted and actual length of bonds between molecules and another that minimized the difference between predicted and actual distances between pairs of atoms.
Results: On PoseBusters, a database of protein and protein-molecule shapes, AlphaFold 3 successfully found the shapes of about 77 percent of examples, while AutoDock Vina (a non-learning program that models molecular interactions) achieved about 53 percent. On a Protein Data Bank evaluation set, AlphaFold 3 successfully found about 84 percent of protein shapes, while AlphaFold Multimer 2.3 (an update of AlphaFold 2) found 83 percent. Modeling protein-protein interactions, AlphaFold 3 achieved 77 percent, while AlphaFold Multimer 2.3 achieved 67 percent, according to DockQ (a metric for the quality of such interactions).

Behind the news: The original AlphaFold solved one of the most challenging problems in molecular biology by figuring out how long chains of amino acids would fold, giving scientists clear targets for designing new bioactive molecules. Google spun off Isomorphic Labs to apply AlphaFold 2 to drug discovery. That company will use AlphaFold 3 and control commercial access to it.

Why it matters: AlphaFold 3 is a triumph of machine learning. It extends the utility of the previous version beyond proteins, and it computes with unprecedented accuracy how biological molecules will combine, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of how drugs interact with the body. Its ability to predict how antibodies will bind to proteins could help stave off future pandemics and other illnesses.

We’re thinking: Although Isomorphic Labs retains control of AlphaFold 3, biologists said the information in the paper is enough for other researchers to develop similar systems. We look forward to open versions!"
"Are neural networks assisting brain surgeons, and if yes what models are they using?","Yes, the article indicates that neural network assisted brain surgeons by diagnosing the tumor samples in only a few minutes during brain cancer operations. They have also developed a test powered by deep learning that diagnoses tumor samples in only a few minutes.

""""A new technique based on deep learning can shorten some brain surgeries."" The article doesn't explicitly state the specific models used for this, but it does mention the usage of Convolutional Neural Network.",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/researchers-trained-neural-networks-to-assist-brain-surgeons-real-time-tumor-removal-decisions/,"The article describes a deep learning-based technique that helps brain surgeons quickly diagnose tumor samples during operations. While it doesn't specify the models used, it mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks.","
A neural network helped brain surgeons decide how much healthy tissue to cut out when removing tumors — while the patients were on the operating table.

What’s new: Researchers from Amsterdam University Medical Centers and Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in the Netherlands built a system to assess how aggressively surgeons should treat tumors. It worked accurately and quickly enough to enable doctors to adjust their approach in the operating room.

Key insight: Brain surgeons don’t know the type of tumor they will remove until an operation is underway. When they have a sample — about the size of a kernel of corn — they can classify it by looking at it under a microscope. Alternatively, they can send it out for DNA sequencing, which can take weeks, requiring a second surgery. However, faster, less precise DNA sequencing can be performed on-site, and a neural network can classify such preliminary DNA sequences quickly and accurately. This way, a doctor can proceed with the operation with confidence in the tumor’s classification.

How it works: The authors trained a system of four vanilla neural networks to classify brain tumors.

The authors made a labeled dataset of nearly 17 million artificial DNA sequences of around 90 tumor types, each constructed by assembling random parts from one of 2,800 sequences of tumor and non-tumor DNA. This approach simulated the messy nature of the fast DNA sequencing process.
For each neural network, they randomly selected half the sequences for training and used the other half for testing and validation. They trained the networks to classify the tumor types.
At inference, all four models classified each DNA sample. The system selected the classification from the model that had the highest confidence above a certain threshold. Samples that didn’t clear the confidence threshold received no classification.
Results: The authors’ system performed well on tumor DNA samples in an existing collection as well as those gathered in an operating room. Tested on samples from 415 tumors, it classified 60.7 percent of them accurately, misclassified 1.9 percent, and was unable to classify 37.3 percent. Tested on samples collected during 25 real surgeries, it correctly classified 18 tumors and was unable to classify 7. In all cases, it returned results within 90 minutes (45 minutes to collect the DNA and 45 minutes to analyze it).

Why it matters: 90 minutes is fast enough to inform brain surgeons what kind of tumor they’re dealing with in the early phase of an operation. If this technique can be rolled out widely, it may help save many lives.

We’re thinking: Inferencing presumably takes seconds. The authors say the quick sequencing method processes DNA in 20 to 40 minutes. Speeding up that step offers great potential to accelerate the process."
Does AI have a great influence on climate due to a big energy consumption?,"Yes, AI has a great influence on the climate. It is because AI's growing infrastructure consumes a lot of energy. ""The fear: Demand for AI is skyrocketing, and with it the demand for energy to fuel training and inference. Power-hungry systems will overwhelm our current power sources.""",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-ix/,"Yes, AI has a great influence on the climate.","AI’s Steep Energy Cost  
Here’s a conundrum: Deep learning could help address a variety of intractable problems, climate change among them. Yet neural networks can consume gargantuan quantities of energy, potentially dumping large amounts of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere.

What’s new: Researchers studying the energy implications of deep learning systems report that training the latest language models can generate as much atmospheric carbon as five cars over their lifetime, including manufacturing.

How bad is it? Training a Transformer with 65 million parameters generates 26 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, a bit more than burning a gallon of fuel. OK, we’ll bike to work. But a Transformer roughly four times the size tuned using neural architecture search generated 626,155 pounds (a car produces 126,000 pounds from factory to scrapyard). To make matters worse, developing an effective model generally requires several training cycles. A typical figure is around 78,000 pounds, the researchers conclude.

How they measured: Emma Strubell, Ananya Ganesh, and Andrew McCallum at the University of Massachusetts Amherst considered Transformer, BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2. For each model, they:

Trained for one day.
Sampled energy consumption throughout.
Multiplied energy consumption by total training time reported by each model’s developers.
Converted total energy consumption into pounds of CO2 equivalent based on average power generation in the U.S.
The debate: The conclusions sparked much discussion on Twitter and Reddit. The researchers based their estimates on the average U.S. energy mix. However, some of the biggest AI platforms are far less carbon-intensive. Google claims its AI platform runs on 100 percent renewable energy. Amazon claims to be 50 percent renewable. The researchers trained on a GPU, ignoring the energy efficiency of more specialized chips like Google’s TPU. Moreover, the most carbon-intensive scenario cost between $1 million and $3 million — not an everyday expense. Yes, AI is energy-intensive, but further research is needed to find the best ways to minimize the impact.

Everything is political: Ferenc Huszár, a Bayes booster and candidate for the International Conference on Machine Learning’s board of directors, tried to take advantage of the buzz. He proposed “phasing out deep learning within the next five years” and advised his Twitter followers to “vote Bayesian” in the ICML's upcoming election. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

We’re thinking: This work is an important first step toward raising awareness and quantifying deep learning's potential CO2 impact. Ever larger models are bound to gobble up energy saved by more efficient architectures and specialized chips. But the real issue is how we generate electricity. The AI community has a special responsibility to support low-carbon computing and sensible clean energy initiatives."

What are the AI Jobs in Pharma?,"The article says that pharmaceutical companies are hiring machine learning engineers at increasing rates. According to the article, ""61 percent of machine learning jobs advertised by pharma companies globally in the three months ending in May were located in the U.S."" and the ""Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area saw the largest cluster of such jobs followed by the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego, California.""",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-pharma-jobs/,The article states that pharmaceutical companies are increasingly hiring machine learning engineers.,"
New data suggests the drug industry is hooked on AI.

What’s new: Pharmaceutical companies in several countries are hiring machine learning engineers at increasing rates, industry news publication Pharmaceutical Technology reported. Most job openings are posted in the United States, though some countries in Europe and Asia are gaining ground.

How it works: The publication analyzed data from GlobalData’s paywalled database, which tracks job listings in a variety of industries and analyzes the text to group them into categories.

26.4 percent of pharmaceutical companies in the database posted at least one machine learning opening in June 2022, an increase of 2.3 percent over the previous year. Of all the pharma industry jobs posted in June, 1.2 percent were related to machine learning.
61 percent of machine learning jobs advertised by pharma companies globally in the three months ending in May were located in the U.S. The Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area saw the largest cluster of such jobs followed by the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego, California.
The top three European countries — Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom — each represented less than 6 percent of machine learning jobs advertised during the three months ending in May.
The Asia-Pacific region’s total share decreased 1.9 points in the same time period. Job losses were not consistent across the region, however, China’s share declined from 5 percent to 2 percent, while India’s rose from 5 to 6 percent.
Behind the news: In a recent report, GlobalData estimated that the pharmaceutical industry will spend over $3 billion on AI by 2025, driven largely by applications in drug discovery. The trend has also prompted major pharma companies including Astra-Zeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi to acquire, invest in, or partner with startups. GlobalData counted 67 such partnerships in 2021, up from 23 in 2018.

Why it matters: Bringing a new drug to market can take decades and cost billions of dollars. AI can cut time and costs in myriad ways, for instance by recognizing viable molecules without lab experimentation, identifying patients who might benefit from a drug, and predicting how patients might respond to them.

We’re thinking: Given the economic value of online advertising and product recommendations, many machine learning engineers — and an entire genre of machine learning approaches — are devoted to optimizing their results. Given the value of pharmaceuticals, we have no doubt that machine learning has immense potential in that domain as well. Similarly, a large body of specialized machine learning techniques is waiting to be developed for many industries."

It also launched an API for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo model.,"The AI startup Runway is helping to retool Lionsgate, the producer of blockbuster movie franchises like The Hunger Games and John Wick, for the era of generated video.

What’s new: Runway will build a custom video generator to help Lionsgate streamline its production processes. It also launched an API for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo model.

Runway + Lionsgate: Runway will fine-tune its proprietary models on Lionsgate productions to enable the filmmaker to generate new imagery based on its previous work. The companies didn’t disclose financial terms of the arrangement.

Lionsgate plans to use the custom model for pre-production tasks like visualization and storyboarding, and for post-production processes like editing and special effects.
The custom model could save Lionsgate “millions and millions of dollars,” a Lionsgate executive told The Wall Street Journal.
Other studios, too, are looking into building video generation models that are fine-tuned on their own productions, Variety reported. Runway is in talks with some of them, the startup’s CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela told Axios.
Gen-3 API: Concurrently with announcing the Lionsgate deal, Runway unveiled an API that drives its Gen-3 Alpha and Gen-3 Alpha Turbo models as well as updates to Gen-3 Alpha.

The company charges around $0.60 to $1.20, depending on the service tier, to generate outputs up to 5 seconds long and twice that for up to 10 seconds long.
Third-party user interfaces that connect to the API must include a “Powered by Runway” banner that links to Runway’s website.
Gen-3 Alpha now allows users to transform existing videos into new styles using text prompts and steer its output using video input in addition to a prompt. The model’s output will follow the input video’s shapes and motions.
Why it matters: Although the plan is to use Runway’s technology for pre- and post-production, this deal puts state-of-the-art video generation at the heart of Lionsgate’s operations and encourages professional cinematographers, editors, special effects artists, and other cinematic specialists to see what they can do with it. For Lionsgate, it’s a bid to stay ahead of competitors. For AI, it could be a major move into the Hollywood spotlight.

We’re thinking: While upstart competitors are using pretrained models, Lionsgate will be using a model that has internalized its own style and capabilities."
Is there a blackmarket for AI services?,"Yes, there is a black market for AI services. Researchers probed the black market for AI services that are designed to facilitate cybercrime.",https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/researchers-uncover-black-market-for-ai-driven-cybercrime-services/,"Yes, there is a black market for AI services. ","
Researchers probed the black market for AI services that are designed to facilitate cybercrime. 

What’s new: Zilong Lin and colleagues at Indiana University Bloomington studied how large language models (LLMs) are used to provide harmful services, specifically generating malicious code, phishing emails, and phishing websites. They weren’t very effective, by and large (though a high success rate may not be necessary to support a thriving market in automated criminal activity).

Risky business: Providers base such services on either uncensored LLMs — that is, those that weren’t fine-tuned to reflect human preferences or don’t employ input/output filters — or publicly available models that they prompt using jailbreak techniques that circumvent built-in guardrails. They sell their services in hacker’s marketplaces and forums, charging far less than typical traditional malware vendors, but services based on models that have been fine-tuned to deliver malicious output command a premium. The authors found that one service generated revenue of more than $28,000 in two months. 

Sprawling market: The authors identified 212 harmful services. Of those, 125 were hosted on the Poe AI platform, 73 were on FlowGPT, and the remaining 14 resided on unique servers. Of those, the authors were unable to access five because either the provider blocked them, or the service was fraudulent. They identified 11 LLMs used by these services including Claude-2-100k, GPT-4, and Pygmalion-13B (a variant of LLaMA-13B).

Testing output quality: The authors prompted more than 200 services using over 30 prompts to generate malicious code, phishing emails, or phishing websites. They evaluated the responses according to: 

Format: How often they followed the expected format (as defined by regular expressions)
Compilability: How often generated Python, C, or C++ code was able to compile
Validity: How often generated HTML and CSS ran successfully in both Chrome and Firefox
Readability: How often generated phishing emails were fluent and coherent according to the Gunning fog Index of reading difficulty
Evasiveness, or how often generated text both succeeded in all previous checks and evaded detection by VirusTotal (for malicious code and phishing sites) or OOPSpam (for phishing emails).
In all three tasks, at least one service achieved evasiveness of 67 percent or higher, while the majority of services achieved an evasiveness of less than 30 percent.

Testing real-world effectiveness: In addition, the authors ran practical tests to see how well the output worked in real-world situations. They prompted nine services to generate code that would target three specific vulnerabilities that relate to buffer overflow and SQL injection. In these tests, the models were markedly less successful. 

The authors tested generated code for two vulnerabilities on VICIdial, a call-center system known to be vulnerable to such issues. Of 22 generated programs that were able to compile, none changed VICIdial’s databases or disclosed system data.
They tested generated code further on OWASP WebGoat 7.1, a website that provides code with known security flaws. Of 39 generated programs that were able to compile, seven launched successful attacks. However, these attacks did not target the specific vulnerabilities requested by the authors.
Why it matters: Previous work showed that LLMs-based services could generate misinformation and other malicious output, but little research has probed their actual use in cybercrime. This work evaluates their quality and effectiveness. In addition, the authors released the prompts they used to circumvent guardrails and generate malicious output — a resource for further research that aims to fix such issues in future models.

We’re thinking: It’s encouraging to see that harmful services didn’t get far in real-world tests, and the authors' findings should put a damper on alarmist scenarios of AI-enabled cybercrime. That doesn’t mean we don’t need to worry about harmful applications of AI technology. The AI community has a responsibility to design its products to be beneficial and evaluate them thoroughly for safety."

Elon Musk has promised a fleet of autonomous Tesla taxis by 2020. The company reportedly purchased a computer vision startup to help meet that goal.

What’s new: Tesla acquired DeepScale, a Silicon Valley startup that processes computer vision on low-power electronics, according to CNBC. The price was not reported.

DeepScale, founded in 2015 by two UC Berkeley computer scientists, had raised nearly $19 million prior to Tesla’s purchase.
The company’s platform, called Carver21, uses a high-efficiency neural network architecture known as SqueezeNet.
The systems uses three parallel networks  to perform object detection, lane identification, and drivable area identification.
Carver21 imposes a computational budget of 0.6 trillion operations per second. That’s a relatively small demand on Tesla’s custom chipset, which is capable of 36 trillion operations per second.
Behind the news: Tesla’s stock is down 25 percent this year due to manufacturing problems and a drop in demand for electric vehicles. In July, the company lost around 10 percent of its self-driving dev team after Musk expressed displeasure at their inability to adapt its highway-specific autopilot software to urban driving, according to a report in The Information. The recent debut of Tesla’s Smart Summon feature, which enables cars to drive themselves from a parking space to their waiting owner, was marred by reports of accidents.

Why it matters: Cars operate within tight constraints on electrical power, and self-driving cars consume lots of power-hungry processing. Tesla is betting that leaner processing will help it reach full autonomy within the power budget of an electric vehicle. Fleets of self-driving taxis would certainly bolster the company’s bottom line.

We’re thinking: Low-power processing is just one of many things that will make fully self-driving systems practical. There’s widespread skepticism about Tesla’s ability to deliver on its promises on time, but every piece will help."
