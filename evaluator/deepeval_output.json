The code and weights are licensed freely for commercial and personal use, including training new models on R1 outputs. The paper provides an up-close look at the training of a high-performance model that implements a chain of thought without explicit prompting. (DeepSeek-R1-lite-preview came out in November with fewer parameters and a different base model.)\\n\\nMixture of experts (MoE) basics: The MoE architecture uses different subsets of its parameters to process different inputs. Each MoE layer contains a group of neural networks, or experts, preceded by a gating module that learns to choose which one(s) to use based on the input. In this way, different experts learn to specialize in different types of examples. Because not all parameters are used to produce any given output, the network uses less energy and runs faster than models of similar size that use all parameters to process every input.\\n\\nHow it works: DeepSeek-R1 is a version of DeepSeek-V3-Base that was fine-tuned over four stages to enhance its ability to process a chain of thought (CoT). It\\u2019s a mixture-of-experts transformer with 671 billion total parameters, 37 billion of which are active at any given time, and it processes 128,000 tokens of input context. Access to the model via DeepSeek\\u2019s API costs $0.55 per million input tokens ($0.14 for cached inputs) and $2.19 per million output tokens. (In comparison, o1 costs $15 per million input tokens, $7.50 for cached inputs, and $60 per million output tokens.)\\n\\nThe team members fine-tuned DeepSeek-V3-Base on a synthetic dataset of thousands of long-form CoT examples that were generated using multiple techniques. For instance, they prompted DeepSeek-V3-Base few-shot style with long CoTs as examples, prompted that model to generate detailed answers while evaluating and double-checking its own CoT steps,  and hired human annotators to refine and process the results.\\nThey used group relative policy optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to improve the model\\u2019s ability to solve challenging problems. For example, for math problems, they created rule-based systems that rewarded the model for returning the final answer in a particular format (an accuracy reward) and for showing its internal CoT steps within <think> tags (a format reward).\\nFor further fine-tuning, they used the in-progress versions of R1 to generate around 600,000 responses to reasoning prompts, retaining only correct responses. They mixed in another 200,000 non-reasoning examples (such as language translation pairs) either generated by DeepSeek-V3-base or from its training dataset.\\nThey fine-tuned the model using a final round of reinforcement learning. This step encouraged the model to further boost its accuracy on reasoning problems while generally improving its helpfulness and harmlessness.\\nOther models: DeepSeek researchers also released seven related models.\\n\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero is similar to DeepSeek-R1, but fine-tuned entirely using reinforcement learning. The researchers note that DeepSeek-R1-Zero was able to develop problem-solving strategies simply by being given incentives to do so. However, it was more likely to mix languages and produce unreadable outputs.\\nDeepSeek also released six dense models (with parameter counts of 1.5 billion, 7 billion, 8 billion, 14 billion, 32 billion, and 70 billion), four of them based on versions of Qwen, and two based on versions of Llama.\\nResults: In DeepSeek\\u2019s tests, DeepSeek-R1 went toe-to-toe with o1, outperforming that model on 5 of 11 of the benchmarks tested.
